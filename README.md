alignsnap

This script uses openCV to display a streamed image from a USB camera and allows the user to click on the image to display a vertical cross hair. Subsequent clicks will show a second cross hair and an additional cross hair marking the average location. This is helpful when aligning to a rotation axis.

In order to run, [openCV](openCV.org) must be installed and available on your path.
